If you have found your way here. Let me be the first to say, Thanks. I'm going to keep this one short. 

I started this blog for 3 reasons: 

1. To practice comprehending what I learn in my studies as a software developer.
2. To practice elaborating my feelings about topics in the political realm. Frankly, everything sounds good in your head, until you try to speak your thoughts into existence. They tend to come apart at the seams because they've never been spoken. So my goal is to practice elaborating my own thoughts.
3.  And finally, I've always wanted to become a better writer. It's 2019, I kinda need to figure that part out.

Thanks for reading about my ambiguous goals for this blog, follow me on twitter an stay tuned!
